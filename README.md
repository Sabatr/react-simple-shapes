# react-library-boilerplate

Simple boilerplate code for creating a React Component Library. 

To use, clone the repo using

```
git clone https://github.com/Sabatr/react-library-boilerplate
```
and then type:

```
npm install
```

A lib folder will need to be added as this will be your entrypoint to the module.

When installed, you can run the build to test your components. 

```
npm run build
```

Delete the Test directory if you want to change :)
